	things (anything registered through the event)
default template add
	size (xxx Kilobytes)
	est. reading time (size/readrate=num of min)
add random field in story post to prevent batch posting?
in str_parse(), replace the while loop in html attr parsing with m//cg

	for)
	- make udf more generic: comments.inc and stories.inc (and users.inc
	  in thraxx) will be removed
change OF to add ?session_id= for links
set $babs->{session_id} in require_login() or perhaps __session_init()
add template parsing option "simple variables only" ::= '$' \w+
convert DBH -> DBI (remove DBH dependence)
provide a pretty page for when statements such as "use ..." or compile errors occur
on user-input <pre> sections, distribute newlines like spaces are in run-on words
